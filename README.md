A Special Paper Session of ASRU 2025.


- Open Voice-Chat Agentic Model Design, Evaluation and Benchmarking

- This special session aims to foster the design of open voice-chat agentic systems and the definition of evaluation benchmarks for such agents. Recent advances in speech technology and large language models (LLMs) have enabled voice-based conversational agents that can engage in free-form dialogue and carry out complex tasks. However, the field currently lacks well-defined tasks and standardized metrics to evaluate these multimodal dialogue systemsâ€™ performance.
